# **SYNOPSIS**

Typhoid or Enteric fever disease caused by Salmonella Typhi remains a serious health problem worldwide including in Cameroon, Africa. Despite the conventional methods of diagnosing Typhoid such as:
Isolating the causative organism from the body fluids
Antibody detection tests
the misdiagnosis is present due to the lack of advanced evaluation in both methods.
The focus of Mboalb is combining AI systems with an irreplaceable human clinician to bring an innovative solution for an early and better diagnosis.

The goal is to use the microcultures test with the blood which seems to be the best accepted by the laboratory technicians. To train the algorithm, using CNNs as algorithms on the collected images is proposed.
The choice of the algorithm will depend on the volume of the images obtained and/or in hand. In the case of having fewer images, the Transfer Learning method could be used to automate the test of microbiological cultures.


### **CURRENT STATUS OF THE PROJECT**

Depending on the research by the team, the Transfer Learning method is reliable at 61%, and to reinforce the reliability of this test using the second algorithm which is a fast decision tree learner is planned. This algorithm based on 18 symptoms variables will allow research not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease. The main challenge of the project is the availability of local and high-quality open data.
